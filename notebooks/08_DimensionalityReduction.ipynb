    "## Introduction  \n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction algorithms are widely used in data mining. Human perception of relationships in data is limited beyond a few dimensions. Further, many data mining algorithms produce poor results where when there is significant dependency between the features or variables. In both cases, we can apply dimensionality reduction methods.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In the exercises in this notebook you will gain some experience working with some commonly used dimensionality reduction methods. Specifically, there are two distinct classes of algorithms you will explore:    \n",
    "1. **Dimensionality reduction transformation methods** create operators to map a sample (feature) space to an orthogonal space. Typically the original data can be well-represented in lower dimensions in the orthogonal space. Examples of these methods include principle component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD).    \n",
    "2. **Manifold learning methods** where data in a high dimensional space is mapped onto a lower-dimensional manifold. When the projection is to a low dimension, manifold learning is used to aid visualization of high-dimensional data. Alternatively, manifold learning can be used as a nonlinear map for dimensionality reduction for further analysis.   "
